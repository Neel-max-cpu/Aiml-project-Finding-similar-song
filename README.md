### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python(v3)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Neel-max-cpu/Aiml-project-Finding-similar-song.git](https://github.com/Neel-max-cpu/AdminDashboard.git)
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:
```
cd frontend
```

```
cd backend
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend:
```
npm install
```
create an .env file and write your api key
```
VITE_API_KEY="your api key"
```

For the backend you need to check and install the dependencies directly or can do it from requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Important to, download the dataset you can go to MillionSongData's website [Link](http://millionsongdataset.com/) here.
I have used the million song subset(1.8gb) the full data set if of 280gb. Download it and keep the file in the public folder of the backend.

### Step 4: Set Up the Environment Variables
Create the .env file, just paste your api(can be fetched from here [Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)).
Create an account and enable YouTube Data API v3 and create an api key.


### Usage
After setting up the environment variables, you can start the application.


### How to Run
### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
Before running the backend build/precompute your faiss index.
Navigate to the corefolder then build_faiss_index.py run that command or directly run the command from the backend folder, wait for it as it can take sometime!
```
cd backend\app\core
python build_faiss_index.py
```
or

```
python app/core/build_faiss_index.py

```

Navigate to the server directory and start the backend server, set it to virtual environment and start the server:
```
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
In a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory and start the React application:
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5173/ to access the App.
